I am a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT Transit Lab](https://www.transitlab.mit.edu/researchers) and [Urban Mobility Lab](https://mobility.mit.edu/people) working with Professor [Jinhua Zhao](https://dusp.mit.edu/faculty/jinhua-zhao). I got my Ph.D. in Transportation Systems from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) under supervision of Professor [Haris Koutsopoulos](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/koutsopoulos-haris/), and my BSc in Civil Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/). 

During my doctoral dissertation research, my focus was on 1) developing real-time transit demand prediction models 2) real-time crowding prediction and predictive passenger information in transit networks. I also leveraged Deep Learning and natural language processing techniques for text mining of transit incident reports. I am currently working on projects with Transport for London, as well as the Mass Transit Railway in Hong Kong, working on integration of public transit and autonomous mobility-on-demand services.
