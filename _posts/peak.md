1. Experts have better mental models of the problem domain 
2. Experts have better mechanisms for organizing and retrieving information 
3. "Deliberate Practice"
4. Be mindful of where/how mistakes are made. Break the task into smaller chuncks and fix those. For example, practice specific segments where more mistakes are made, as opposed to practicing the thing in one go. 
5. We don't have universal athletes. Rather, we have gymnasts, footballers, basketball players, etc. We have to decide what to work on. Then the brain adapts.
